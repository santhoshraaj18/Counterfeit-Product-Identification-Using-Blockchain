# Counterfeit Product Identification Using Blockchain

This repository contains research and documentation on counterfeit product identification using blockchain technology. The project explores a system that helps customers verify product authenticity using QR codes stored on a decentralized blockchain network.

## 📌 Overview
Counterfeit products affect supply chains globally, leading to financial losses and reputational damage for manufacturers. This system integrates blockchain technology and QR code scanning to allow users to validate whether a product is genuine or fake.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Uses blockchain for secure and immutable product tracking.
- Generates a unique QR code for every product stored in a decentralized ledger.
- Consumers can scan the QR code to retrieve verified product details.
- Eliminates reliance on third-party verifications for product authenticity.

## 🏗️ System Workflow
1. **Product Registration:** Manufacturer uploads product details into the blockchain.
2. **QR Code Generation:** The system generates a unique QR code for each product.
3. **Verification:** Customers scan the QR code, and the system retrieves details from the blockchain.
4. **Authentication Check:** If data matches, the product is genuine; otherwise, it's counterfeit.

## 📄 Research Paper
This repository is based on our research paper titled _"Counterfeit Product Identification Using Blockchain."_ It details the methodology, implementation, and findings of the project.Link to paper : https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2306567.pdf

## 📢 Future Enhancements
- Implementation of embedded chips to prevent QR code replication.
- Optimization of blockchain storage to handle large-scale product tracking.
